# Sintax direct translation: Boolean Calculator

## Abstract
Design of a grammar and his implementation using a top-down/ bottom-top analyzer/translator that represent a boolean calculator using python.

### Introduction

The boolean calculator allow this operations represented by the examples of this table:

| Input                           | Output          |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| x := true;                      |                 |
| print x;                        | The result is 1 |
| y := false and x;               |                 |
| print not y;                    | The result is 1 |
| print x and not y;              | The result is 1 |
| print not (x and not y);        | The result is 0 |
| x := not x;                     |                 |
| z := true or not (x and not y); |                 |

- There are `Id's ` 
- There are `or`  binary and left asociative.
- There are `and` and is binary and left asociative and more priority than the `or` operator.
- There are asign operator `:=`
- There are print sentence `print *values*`
- There are `True` and `False` constants.
- There are `()`


## Methodology

### Stage : 1

Design the grammar for a bottom-top translator with his translation scheme.

| Sintactic rules                  | Semantic rules                        |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| entry -> `print` expr ;          | write('The result is {expr.s} ;')     |
| entry -> Ïµ                       |                                       |
| def -> asign ;                   |                                       |
| asign -> ID `=` asign            | table[ID] = expr.s                    |
| asign -> expr                    | asign.s = expr.s                      |
| expr -> exprOR                   | expr.s = exprOR.s                     |
| exprOR -> exprOR 'or' exprAND    | exprOR.s = exprOR_1.s or exprAND.s    |
| exprOR -> exprAND                | exprOR.s = exprAND.s                  |
| exprAND -> exprAND 'and' boolean | exprAND.s = exprAND_1.s and boolean.s |
| exprAND -> boolean               | exprAND.s = boolean.s                 |
| boolean -> not boolean           | boolean.s = !boolean.s                |
| boolean -> `CBOOLEAN`            | boolean.s = `CBOOLEAN`.lexval         |
| boolean -> ID                    | boolean.s = table[ID]                 |
| boolean -> `(` expr `)`          | boolean.s = expr.s                    |



### Stage: 2

Adapt the grammar for a top-bottom translator. For do that we have to transform the left recursion to right recursion and refactorize the resulting grammar.

| Sintactic rules                    |
|------------------------------------|
| entry -> `print` def;              |
| entry -> e                         |
| def -> asign ;                     |
| asign -> ID `=` asign              |
| asign -> expr                      |
| expr -> exprOR                     |
| exprOR -> exprAND exprOR'          |
| exprOR' -> 'or' exprAND exprOR'    |
| exprOR' -> e                       |
| exprAND -> boolean exprAND'        |
| exprAND' -> 'and' boolean exprAND' |
| exprAND' -> e                      |
| boolean -> not boolean             |
| boolean -> `CBOOLEAN`              |
| boolean -> ID                      |
| boolean -> `(` expr `)`            |


### Stage: 3

Add the translation scheme to stage 2 adapting the semantic rules of stage 1.

### Stage: 4

Implement the top-bottom recursive translator resuling from stage 3 using *Python*.
